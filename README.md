# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game
This project is about the analysis of viewership of Super Bowl, an American Football Championship and the factors affecting it. The various factors affecting it are in the form of blowouts, comebacks, outcomes, controversies, advertisements and halftime shows. In this project, we import, clean and analyze our datasets and answer the questions like : What are the most extreme game outcomes? How does the game affect television viewership? How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time? Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
